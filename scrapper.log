But overall the camera is good and it will do the job. ..."}, {'Product': 'iphone', 'Name': 'Flipkart Customer', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Best in the market!', 'Comment': 'Excellent smart phone, Good battery backup and performance is very good, Good camera quality.'}, {'Product': 'iphone', 'Name': 'Flipkart Customer', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Terrific', 'Comment': 'Damn such a great phone.
